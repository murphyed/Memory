Dynamic array: 
is an array that can grow or shrink in size at runtime. When elements are added to a dynamic array, it typically allocates a new block of memory that is larger than the current block, copies the existing elements to the new block, and then adds the new elements to the end of the array. 

Singly linked list: 
is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, each of which contains a value and a reference to the next node in the list. The first node is called the head of the list, and the last node's reference points to null.
